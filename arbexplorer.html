        <a style="cursor: pointer" href="https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">The Arnold Arboretum</a>
         is a cherised park in Boston that contains a vast collection of rare and beautiful trees. The park is free and open to the public, and offers a variety
         of online tools that let you explore the park from home. One of these tools is
         <a style="cursor: pointer" href="https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/explorer/" target="_blank">the ArbExplorer.</a> While working on the 
         team I was tasked with developing a creative brief around reimagining what this tool could look like.

        <p>As with any creative brief, digging into research and conducting my own was the first step. Looking through the audience matrix and various interviews, 
            I was able to identify what sort of audiences the ArbExplorer was attracting, and the main usability issues. A lot of time was also spent
            using the interface, and dissecting and tracking its content and functionality
        </p>
        <p> After getting a good sense of the ArbExplorer and understanding its flaws and intricacies, I then started to collect adjacent information and inspiration. 
            This meant looking through current mapping software and pinpointing reoccurring user experience trends, and finding ways to bring these into our proposed
            redesign.

        <p>Before knowing what the final deliverable of this project would look like, I began going around and asking strangers what they would add.
            This became a big part of my process, and I spent a few weeks going out into the public and talking to strangers and telling them about my project and asking them to participate. 
            Two big struggles with this process, was that it took a massive amount of time, and it was also very difficult getting genuine answers from people. 
            Understandably, itâ€™s hard to open up to someone you just met. After getting a large amount of content from people willing to contribute, this brought me to a new question.</p>
